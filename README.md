# Tailwind Starter Theme for WinterCMS

Preconfigured with TailwindCSS v3.0.16 + Plugins (Typography, Forms) + AlpineJS

### Tailwind CLI

This setup is based on Tailwind CLI with a Linux x64 server. This should work on most LAMP Stack environments.

**Not using Linux server?**

The Tailwind CLI is also available for Windows and Mac environments. Please see official documentation from Tailwind:

[Standalone CLI: Use Tailwind CSS without Node.js â€“ Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/standalone-cli)

## How to use

(Alternatively, open in a file browser and set permissions to 0755)
